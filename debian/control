Description: Tool for examining the internals of Qt application
 GammaRay is a tool for examining the internals of a Qt application and
 to some extent also manipulate it. GammaRay uses injection methods to
 hook into an application at runtime and provide access to a wide variety
 of interesting information. It provides easy ways of navigating through
 the complex internal structures you find in some Qt frameworks, such as
 QGraphicsView, model/view, QTextDocument, state machines and more.

Description: GammaRay support for inspecting Qt4 applications
 This package contains GammaRay probe libraries that have to be loaded
 into the application being inspected in order to allow GammaRay to
 examine its internals. The gammaray package already includes the probe
 binaries compiled for Qt5. Install this package if you want to use
 GammaRay with Qt4 applications.

Description: QObject hierarchy visualization plugin for GammaRay
 This plugin can visualize parent-child relationships of QObjects in a
 form of planar or 3D acyclic graph. Multiple graph layout algorihtms
 are available.
 .
 Also, for use with 3D glasses, various types of stereoscopic rendering
 are supported.

Description: GammaRay plugin for inspecting QtQuick2 applications
 This plugin provides the user with the following inspection and debugging
 facilities:
 .
  * Tree view of all QQuickItems in the scene, marking invisible items
    and items having focus.
  * Object inspector allowing to see all the properties, inspect
    signal-slot connections, and directly invoke slots and Q_INVOKABLE
    methods.
  * Live-preview of the QtQuick scene inside the GammaRay window.
  * Qt Quick scene graph inspector.
